# Text Analysis and Statistical Testing

This repository contains a Python project focused on statistical analysis of text data. The project involves processing a dataset to calculate various linguistic metrics and performing hypothesis tests to understand the properties of text features.

**Features**
**Data Cleaning:** Removal of irrelevant columns and conversion of string-based numerical data to appropriate formats.
Descriptive Statistics: Calculation of means, confidence intervals, and visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn.
**Hypothesis Testing:**
One-sample T-tests to check whether the means of different linguistic metrics (e.g., TTR, Entropy, Average Token Length) differ significantly from hypothesized values.
Two-sample T-tests to compare the means of these metrics between two independent datasets.


**Usage:**
Load your dataset in CSV format.
Execute the script to clean and preprocess data.
Perform the statistical tests to analyze the text metrics.
Review the outputs for confidence intervals, p-values, and visualizations.
**Results:**
Statistical tests confirm or reject the null hypotheses for various text features based on their p-values.
Visual representations help in understanding the distribution of text features and confidence intervals.
